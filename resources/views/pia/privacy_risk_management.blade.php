    <p>Welcome to the Privacy Risk Management</p>

    <p>For the purpose of this section, a risk refers to the potential of an incident to result in harm or danger 
    to a data subject or organization. Risks are those that could lead to the unauthorized collection, use, 
    disclosure or access to personal data. It includes risks that the confidentiality, integrity and availability 
    of personal data will not be maintained, or the risk that processing will violate rights of data subjects 
    or privacy principles (transparency, legitimacy and proportionality).</p>
    <p>The first step in managing risks is to identify them, including threats and vulnerabilities, and by 
    evaluating its impact and probability</p>
    <p>The following definitions are used in this section,</p>
    <p>Risk - “the potential for loss, damage or destruction as a result of a threat exploiting a 
    vulnerability”;</p>
    <p>Threat - “a potential cause of an unwanted incident, which may result in harm to a system or 
    organization”;</p>
    <p>Vulnerability - “a weakness of an asset or group of assets that can be exploited by one or more 
    threats”;</p>
    <p>Impact - severity of the injuries that might arise if the event does occur (can be ranked from trivial 
    injuries to major injuries); and</p>
    <p>Probability - chance or probability of something happening;</p>

          <p>Select the appropriate level or criteria of impact and probability to better assess the risk. Kindly refer to the table below for the criteria.</p>
          <p>Note: Try to itemize your risks by designating a reference number. This will be used as a basis on the next sections (VII. Recommended Privacy Solutions and VIII. Sign off and Action Plan). Also, base the risks on the violation of privacy principles, rights of data subjects and confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal data</p>
